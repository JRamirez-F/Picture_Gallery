# Picture Gallery 

In this section, you can see some pictures of living matter, collected over the years using microscopes.

The breathtaking simplicity and the most beautiful complexity.

Thanks to the universities, research centers, and PIs who gave me the opportunity to see the world through a microscope. 

Images in this gallery have been acquired using equipment and funding from the following institutions: Universidad Complutense de Madrid; University of Maryland, Baltimore; Cajal Institute, Madrid (CSIC); Unité de Neurobiologie des Canaux Ioniques et de la Synapse, Aix-Marseille Université-INSERM; Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone, Aix-Marseille Université-CNRS.
