# Picture Gallery 

In this section, you can see some pictures of living matter, collected over the years using microscopes.

Just the breathtaking simplicity of the most beautiful complexity.

Thanks to the universities, research centers, and PIs who, over the years, gave me the opportunity to see the world through a microscope.
